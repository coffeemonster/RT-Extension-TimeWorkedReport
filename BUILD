BUILD
=====

MODULE = RT::Extension::TimeWorkedReport

This MODULE uses MakeMaker with Module::Install.

The Makefile.PL is setup to get 'all_from' and 'readme_from' MODULE.
All changes should be made in MODULE or Makefile.PL.

No changes should be made in README, META.*, MANIFEST.
These are included in the source-tree for completeness to mirror the CPAN dist.

Build CPAN dist
---------------

    make clean
    DIST_BUILD=1 perl Makefile.PL
    make manifest
    # make upload (if cpan-upload installed)
